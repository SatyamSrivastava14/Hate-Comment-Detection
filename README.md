# Hate-Comment-Detection

Welcome to the Hate Comment Detection project repository! This project aims to combat online hate comment by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The code provided here allows you to build a robust Hate Comment Detection model that identifies and flags hate speech and offensive comments in online content.

Key Features:

Data Preparation: We begin by loading and preprocessing the dataset, which involves tasks such as text cleaning, stemming, and removal of stopwords. The cleaned data is then ready for analysis.

Word Cloud Visualization: To gain insights into the most common words in hate comments, we have included a Word Cloud visualization. This visualization provides a visual representation of language patterns in hateful content.

Text Vectorization: We offer two options for text vectorization: Count Vectorization and TF-IDF Vectorization. These techniques transform text data into numerical features that are suitable for machine learning.

Naive Bayes Classifiers: Three Naive Bayes classifiers - Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli - are implemented for comment classification. These classifiers help identify whether a comment is hateful or not.

Performance Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's effectiveness in detecting hate comments.
